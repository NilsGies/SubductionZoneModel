                             DO NOT USE TABS IN PERPLE_X DATA FILES, TAB CHARACTERS ARE NOT INTERPRETED AS BLANK SPACES 
                             AND CAUSE FORMATTING ERRORS.

                             Solution model type flags are:

                             0  - internal (fluid) EoS
                             1  - simple microscopic formulation (bragg-williams fractions)
                             2  - simple macroscopic formulation (endmember fractions)
                             5  - simple macroscopic formulation plus 1 arbitrary dependent endmember
                             6  - macroscopic formulation with speciation.
                             7  - macroscopic formulation reciprocal solution with dependent endmembers.
                             8  - macroscopic formulation reciprocal solution with dependent endmembers and speciation.

                             Special models:

                             23 - Toops-Samis melt model
                             24 - Holland & Powell Haplogranite melt model 
                             25 - Ghirso pMELTS/MELTS model
                             26 - Haefner H2O-CO2-NaCl
                             27 - Silicate vapor (ideal)

                             For non-ideal solutions, microscopic models assume Margules type excess functions; 
                             macroscopic models may be posed in terms of Margules (See model "Bio(HP)" for a commented
                             example) or Van Laar (e.g., Holland and Powell, CMP 2003; See model Fsp(C1) for a commented 
                             example) excess functions. The format of model type 1 is described in detail in the Perple_X 
                             program documentation (vdoc.pdf).
                           
                             The format for all other model types is not yet documented, but may be deduced from the commentary
                             within the models included herein. Character data is format free in all models except model type 1.

                             comments can be placed between models provided, nothing is written in the first 10 columns. Comments 
                             may be placed after data if it is separated from the data by a '|' marker.

                                      i.e., compound formation only occurs for omph.
                                      This model should only be used in conjunction with 
                                      Cpx(HP). The value of wdh appears discrepant 
                                      with the value in HP '98.

                                      The interaction parameters here are from the
                                      Omphacite model distributed with the '00 
                                      Thermocalc program. JADC 2/03

                                      Added ideal acm+cats, JADC, 1/06. 

                                      NOTE: this model does not require Mg/(Fe+Mg)
                                      is the same across sites (as done in Thermocalc).
